# 📐 Linear Algebra 

## 📌 Overview
 I applied my **linear algebra knowledge** and **Python/NumPy skills** to solve real-world problems. The goal was to understand how linear algebra concepts can simplify complex systems and be used in practical applications.

The assignment focuses on two main applications:
- **Webpage navigation modeling** using linear transformations, eigenvalues, and eigenvectors  
- **Dimensionality reduction** using Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

## 🎯 Objective
I was able to:
- Apply **linear transformations**, **eigenvalues**, and **eigenvectors** in a webpage navigation model  
- Apply **PCA** on a dataset to reduce its dimensionality and visualize important features

## 🧠 Methods Used

### 1️⃣ Webpage Navigation Model
- Constructed matrices representing webpage links and user navigation patterns  
- Applied **linear transformations** to model transitions between pages  
- Calculated **eigenvalues and eigenvectors** to identify dominant navigation patterns  
- This approach demonstrates how linear algebra simplifies complex network systems

### 2️⃣ Dimensionality Reduction with PCA
- Used **NumPy** to calculate covariance matrices and eigenvectors  
- Applied **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** to reduce the dataset’s dimensions  
- Visualized the data in lower dimensions while retaining most of the variance  
- PCA helped identify the most important features and simplified data analysis
